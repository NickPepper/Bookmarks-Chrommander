Bookmarks Chrommander IS UNDER CONSTRUCTION
===========================================

So do better not clone the unfinished work. You were warned.


Bookmarks Chrommander
=====================

Google Chrome browser extension. Inspired by 'Bookmark Commander' by Tom J Demuyt, but is better (hopefully).\
For Google Chrome >= version 20.



### Available Scripts

After cloning this repo in the project directory, you can run:

`$ yarn && yarn start`

Then open Chrome, and unpack the newly created /dev folder to see your extension added locally to your browser.\
When youâ€™re ready to ship your extension, create an optimized build with `$ yarn build`.\
You can also use `$ yarn test` which launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\


### Some important files

- Popup UI which renders your index.js when you click on your extension in the browser extension icon.\
- Background script which will run in the background from /background/index.js and can be use for things like state-management.\
- Content script from /contentScript/index.js which will run on configured web pages \
- Options UI which renders your /options/ when you click on your extension in the browser extension icon.\

These are all controlled by the all important /public/manifest.json which is configurable by you to control what kind of extension you want build.

Do not delete any of the entry files, this is a convention to remind you what your extensions could be.\
The build will notify you and fail if you remove any of these important files.
